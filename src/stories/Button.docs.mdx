# Embedding stories by reference in MDX files

In this example `Example.stories.jsx` import an MDX file, which contains
references to stories by their unique ID.

See also [CSF Stories with arbitrary MDX](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/addons/docs/docs/recipes.md#csf-stories-with-arbitrary-mdx).

export const Template = (args) => <Button {...args} />;

## Button

<Story name='test' id='example-mmdx-in-stories--primary-button' />

## HEY

<ArgsTable of={Button} />
_You should be able to see the source of the above story._
